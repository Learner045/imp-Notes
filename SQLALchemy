There’s a huge difference between using SQLite and sqlalchemy. 
Yes, SQLite is so lightweight that it stores everything into a file, 
which may not be powerful enough in some cases, but it’s definitely a good way to test things around at little cost.

As for SQLAlchemy, It’s not a database, it’s an abstract connector to the database.

Why and how is it powerful? With SQLAlchemy, we don’t need to care if we are interacting with a SQLite database, 
a MySQL database or a PostgreSQL database. We only need to tell SQLAlchemy what we want to do with the data, 
and it will automatically connect to the database of our choice, and use the language (dialect) of that database
to manipulate the data. Otherwise, we will have to write different code when we use different databases,
and the code is much longer than we wrote with SQLAlchemy.
